# Project Introduction
## Alcoholic fermentation environment is stressful for S. cerevisiae. In order to survive in such stressful environment, yeast need to change its genetic expression through the different stage of fermentation to adapt to changing nutritional, environmental and physiological conditions. In Rossignol’s paper, they did a fermentation assay with wine yeast S.cerevisiae and characterized a 100h synthetic must fermentation into 6 stages. The total RNA of each stage was extracted. Reverse transcription was applied to the RNA. The cDNA microarray profiling then was used to see the expressing level of 6138 genes. 2000 genes were monitored through this process and were identified to change throughout fermentation. However, their original microarray data is not accessible. The Wu’s paper did a similar microarray experiment in Sake fermentation. They used S. cerevisiae sake yeast which is closely related to wine yeast strain. The microarray data of Wu’s paper is available online. I want to use Wu’s microarray data to generate a similar gene expression change graph of Rossignol’s paper and see if there is different between wine fermentation and sake fermentation.
